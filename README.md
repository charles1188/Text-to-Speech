# Text-to-Speech

How to run the code locally

1. Download the project on your computer.

2. Use a Local Server for Testing
   Live Server Extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
   - Install Live Server from the VS Code Extensions marketplace.
   - Add the text-to-speech folder to your VS code.
   - Start your server by right-clicking on your HTML file (index.html) and selecting "Open with Live Server."

   Installing HTTP server using npm (require node.js installed in your computer):
   - Run the command line/terminal on your system or use the VS code terminal.
   - Execute npm install -g http-server.
   - Once npm finishes, you can run the server by typing http-server.
   - It will display an IP address and a port; click on it or copy and paste it into your browser to use the app.
   - For mobile testing, use the same IP address in your browser.
